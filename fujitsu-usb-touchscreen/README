Fujitsu usb touchscreen kernel module and utilities v0.3.5
by zmiq2 <zzmiq2@gmail.com>, Tue, 20 Jul 2010 18:19:33 +0200

The goal of this project is to produce a useful linux kernel and utilities to use the
fujitsu usb touchscreen included in tablet laptops like the U810 (aka u1010, u820), 
the P1620 and the T1010.

This driver has been tested and proved working on a Fujitsu U810 - 32bit, on a
 Fujitsu P1620 - 64bit and on a Fujitsu T1010 - IA64bit.

INSTALLATION

Installation steps detailed here are based on an ubuntu linux distribution. It might
be different in your system, but they certainly are very easy to adapt to any other
distribution.

Drop me an email if you have trouble installing the package.

0 set your computer BIOS to use the touchscreen in 'tablet' mode
  this is the mode also used by windows, and provides very sharp touchscreen accuracy

1 download the package file to any directory

  $ mkdir fujitsu_touchscreen_driver
  $ cd fujitsu_touchscreen_driver
  $ wget http://<package location>

2 uncompress the package
  $ tar zxvf fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-0.3.7.tar.gz
  $ cd fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-0.3.7

3 install the software
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  (at this last step you'll be asked for your password to install certain software as
root user)

4 setup a startup application for automatic touchscreen rotation
  ubuntu hardy (8.04)
  once logged into gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Sessions, and go to the 'Startup Programs' tab, and Add to automatically start /usr/bin/fujitsu_touchscreen_rotate.py at login

  ubuntu jaunty (9.04), ubuntu karmic (10.04)
  once logged into gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications, and Add to automatically start /usr/bin/fujitsu_touchscreen_rotate.py at login


And you are done!!!

NOTE: you'll need to repeat step 3 every time you upgrade your linux kernel to a new version.



TOUCHSCREEN CALIBRATION

If you feel that the touchscreen calibration is not appropiate, i.e. when clicking on
a point in the screen the cursor appears in a different point, not under where you are
clicking, just run the calibration tool provided.

Calibration must be done when screen is in normal orientation; calibrtaion done it this mode
will make the touchscreen work in all orientations; do not calibrate the screen while
not in normal mode !

Open a terminal and type:

  $ fujitsu_touchscreen_calibration.py


The terminal will start the calibration software. With the laptop stylus, click
several times on each of the four corners of the viewable screen, not the corners of the
hardware screen. When you see that the line "last read" doesn't change after clicking
on the corners, just press S to save the settings and quit.

Also, while in the calibration tool, you can press R to reset current calibration procedure,
or press Q to quit.

After calibration you can see your calibration values running the following command in
a terminal window:

  $ dmesg | grep fujitsu_usb_touchscreen | grep loaded

Please report your computer model and calibration values at spareinfo.blogspot.com to
share with other users.



OTHER SETUP - SCREEN ROTATION

In order to have the touchscreen automatically rotate when rotating the screen, I
suggest you also install the fjbtndrv driver package from the ppa.launchpad.net. With
this package, when pressing the rotate-screen hardware button in the screen bezel in a
U810, the display will rotate and the touchscreen will act accordingly.



OTHER SETUP - RIGHT CLICK ON LONG PRESS

In order to have a long-press act as a right-click, configure gnome assistive
technologies to do so:

ubuntu hardy (8.04)
1 in gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Assistive Technologies and select the
'Enable assistive technologies' check

2 in gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Mouse, then go to Accessibility tab, and
select the 'Trigger secondary click by holding down the primary button' option

ubuntu jaunty (9.04)
1 in gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Assistive Technologies and select the
'Mouse Accesibility' option to get into the details
